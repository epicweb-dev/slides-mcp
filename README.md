# slides-mcp

This uses the [Slides Define API](https://slides.com/developers#define-api) to
allow you to create slides.com presentations from an LLM prompt.

This could be MUCH cooler if slides.com offered a full featured API. I would
love to be able to show templates for the LLM to choose from and have a way to
upload assets as well.
